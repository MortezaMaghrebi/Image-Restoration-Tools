# C# Digital Image Processing Projects

This repository contains C# implementations of various digital image processing algorithms and experiments based on the textbook "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and Woods. The code was written as part of a personal learning project.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following chapters, corresponding to the chapters in the textbook:

* **Chapter 2:** Basic image processing operations such as changing resolution, quantization, interpolation, and connected components analysis.
* **Chapter 3:** Image enhancement techniques including gamma correction, contrast stretching, histogram equalization, noise reduction, and filtering.
* **Chapter 4:** Frequency domain processing, including Fourier transforms, filtering, and aliasing.

Each chapter contains a subdirectory with the corresponding exercises, along with the following files:

* **.exe files:** Compiled executables for each exercise.
* **Source code:** C# source code for the implementation.
* **Screenshots:** Visual examples of the output generated by the programs.

** Example: Notch Filter
